# Landing Page Writer

Create landing page copy that converts by leveraging storytelling and psychological principles.

## Workflow

**Always ask the user which framework to use before writing copy:**

1. **PAS** (Pain-Agitation-Solution) - Best for problem-aware audiences. See [references/pas.md](references/pas.md)
2. **Before-After Bridge** - Best for transformation-focused offers. See [references/before-after.md](references/before-after.md)
3. **StoryBrand SB7** - Best for comprehensive brand narratives. See [references/storybrand.md](references/storybrand.md)

After user selects a framework, read the corresponding reference file before writing.

## Core Principles

- **Customer is the hero**, not the brand. The brand is the guide.
- **Use "you"** to put the prospect in the story.
- **Sell transformation**, not features. People buy a better future.
- **If you confuse, you'll lose.** Clarity over cleverness.
- **Emotional triggers**: self-image (how they want to feel) and social image (how others perceive them).

## Section Blueprint

### 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)

Must convince visitors to stay within 5 seconds.

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Promise the desired result or transformation (emotional buy-in) |
| **Sub-headline** | Explain the "how" - the actual service or offer |
| **Visual** | Show happy end result or customer enjoying transformation (not workers doing the job) |
| **CTA** | Specific action: "Book your free consultation" not "Contact Us". Use "my/me" language. |
| **Opt-in** | Minimum fields (first name, email). Phone numbers drop conversions. |
| **Fear Address** | Line below CTA: "Your info is safe with us" (+7% conversion) |
| **Mini Social Proof** | Star ratings, review count, or client logos |

### 2. Benefits Section

How your offer makes their life better.

- **Benefits vs Features**: Features are things (20 weekly recipes). Benefits are outcomes (less boredom, more variety).
- **Visuals**: Combine with icons or photos. Content with images is 80% more likely to be read.

### 3. Social Proof

72% of people need a positive review before taking action.

- Select testimonials that highlight **specific transformations** or overcome **common objections** (price, time)
- Keep relatively short
- Include 5-star graphic and reviewer photo
- Group in threes

### 4. Objection Buster (FAQ)

Proactively handle uncertainties that kill sales.

- List legitimate questions AND major objections
- Phrase objections as questions
- Provide clear, confident rebuttals
- Common objections: cost, time commitment, complexity, "will this work for me?"

### 5. Final CTA

End with a direct call to action. One last opportunity to convert.

- Restate the transformation
- Clear, specific button
- Optional: Add urgency or scarcity if genuine

## Key Statistics

- Storytelling can improve conversion by **300%**
- Content with visuals is **80% more likely** to be read
- **72%** need positive reviews before acting
- Privacy reassurance below CTA adds **7%** to conversions
