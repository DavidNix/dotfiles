# StoryBrand SB7 Framework

Use this 7-part framework to position the customer as the hero and your brand as the guide who helps them win.

Core rule: **If you confuse, you'll lose.** Keep messaging simple and predictable.

## 1. Character (The Customer)

The customer is the hero, not your brand. Define their desire.

- Identify one clear, survival-related desire (save time, money, status, resources)
- This desire opens a "story gap" - a barrier between them and what they want
- Keep it simple and relevant

## 2. Problem (The Villain)

Every story needs a villain - the obstacle your product defeats.

Three levels of problems to address:
- **External**: The tangible obstacle (broken process, missing tool)
- **Internal**: The frustration or insecurity it causes (this is the real motivator)
- **Philosophical**: The deeper injustice ("it shouldn't be this hard")

Customers buy solutions to internal problems, even when brands sell external fixes.

## 3. Guide (Your Brand)

Customers want a guide, not another hero. Position your brand as the mentor.

Demonstrate two qualities:
- **Empathy**: Show you understand their struggle ("We know how frustrating...")
- **Authority**: Prove competence through:
  - Testimonials (3 is ideal)
  - Statistics ("helped 10,000+ customers")
  - Awards or recognition
  - Logos of known clients

## 4. Plan (The Path)

Give the hero clear steps. Plans reduce confusion and risk.

- **Process Plan**: 3-6 steps to buy or use your product
- **Agreement Plan**: Counter fears with reassurances (guarantees, terms)

Keep steps simple: "1. Schedule a call. 2. Get your custom plan. 3. See results."

## 5. Call to Action (The Challenge)

Heroes don't act unless challenged. Be direct.

Two types:
- **Direct CTA**: High commitment ("Buy Now", "Schedule Today") - make this obvious
- **Transitional CTA**: Low risk, builds trust ("Download Free Guide", "Watch Demo")

## 6. Success (The Transformation)

Show how great life looks after they buy. Resolve all three problem levels.

- External: Problem solved
- Internal: Frustration gone, confidence gained
- Philosophical: Justice restored

Be specific about the transformed life they'll have.

## 7. Failure (The Stakes)

Define what they lose by not acting. Loss aversion motivates.

- Show the cost of inaction
- People fear loss more than they desire gain
- Use sparingly - like salt in a recipe
