# Pain-Agitation-Solution (PAS) Framework

Use this framework to connect with customers by demonstrating you understand their struggle before presenting your solution.

## 1. Pain

Identify the specific pain point your customer is experiencing. Be precise and relatable.

- Name the problem directly
- Use language the customer would use
- Focus on one core pain (not a list)

## 2. Agitate

Intensify the pain by exploring its consequences. This proves you truly understand their situation.

- List the symptoms they're experiencing
- Show how it affects their daily life, work, or relationships
- Describe the emotional toll (frustration, embarrassment, anxiety)
- Paint the picture of what happens if nothing changes
- Goal: Make them think "this person gets me"

## 3. Solution

Present your service as the natural answer to their pain.

- Position your offer as the relief they've been seeking
- Connect directly to the pain and symptoms you described
- Focus on the transformation, not just features
- Make the path forward clear and simple

## Example Structure

**Pain**: "Spending hours every week on [painful task]?"

**Agitate**: "You've tried [common solutions]. But you're still [symptom 1], [symptom 2], and [symptom 3]. Meanwhile, [consequence] and [emotional impact]. Every day without a solution means [what they're losing]."

**Solution**: "With [your service], you get [transformation]. No more [pain]. Instead, [positive outcome]."
