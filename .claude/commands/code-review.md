Do a code review of the current git branch to upstream.

Do NOT make any changes, only give suggestions.

1. Run git diff against the upstream branch which may be "main" or "master" depending on the repo and the currently checked out branch.
2. Suggest any improvements such as simplifications.
3. Point out any potential bugs.
4. Point out any potential security concerns.
5. Do not praise; only focus on what can be improved.
6. If no improvements, then say so.
7. Be concise.
